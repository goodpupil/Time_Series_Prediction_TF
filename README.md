# Time Series Prediction using TensorFlow

## Introduction
* In this Google Colab notebook [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/) to implement machine learning techniques of [Convolutional Neural Networks](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn), Recurrent NN such as [Long Short Term Memory](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/LSTM?version=stable), and [Dense Neural Networks](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dense?version=stable).


## Setup/Usage

## Process

Stock prediction using TensorFlow; utilizing methods of LSTM, DNN and CNN.
